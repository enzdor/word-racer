# Word-Racer

This project is a clone of websites like typeracer, or 10fastfingers. It was made because the UI of typeracer and 10fastfingers has become too cluttered. Moreover, this website has no tracking and no ads. You can visit a live version of the website [here](http://word-racer.vercel.app). 

## Requirements

- node
- npm

## Build

Clone the directory with:

`
git clone https://github.com/enzdor/word-racer
`

Once the directory is cloned, cd into it and run:

`
npm i 
`

After everything is installed run:

`
npm start
`

If there were no problems, the website should be running on port 3000.

## To-do

- Make it possible for users to select how many words they want to type.
- Add favicon.
